# Teaching Linux Kernel Development
The Open Kernel Teaching Project

This project contains slideware and exercises for teaching kernel development. 
As a first step, the project will focus on providing material for a crash-
course, with the goal of giving a wide understanding of what the Linux kernel
is, how the big cogs in its machinery are set up, how it is built, how to debug, where to find documentation and how it is developed in the community.

The intention is to turn students into kernel hackers, capable of contributing upstream and independently continue their studies.

This presentation (from Lund Linux Conference 2017) describes the course with some nice pictures: https://goo.gl/KeiCgD

To build the slideware you need to install the following packages:
	latex-beamer rubber inkscape (assuming you are running ubuntu 16)

Please see our wiki page for more information on the project and how to join the mailing list and contribute.
