Preparing your Raspberry PI for the labs
========================================

Boot up the pi with a serial cable attached.
Start minicom on your PC and login to the raspberry pi (you might need to
press enter to get to the login prompt)

TIP: exit minicom by pressing CTRL-A Q

User: pi
Password: raspberry

Change the default password: 
	sudo passwd

Set root password: 
	sudo passwd root

Change the hostname of your PI so you won't confuse it with any other
on the network:
	su
	echo <new hostname> > /etc/hostname

Enable root ssh login:
	sudo raspi-config
		Enable ssh under "Interfacing options", then quit
	sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	..and change the line "PermitRootLogin without-password" to:
		PermitRootLogin yes
	Exit nano with CTRL-X (remember to save when asked)

Reboot:
	sudo reboot now

Check IP adress:
	ifconfig
	eth0 ...
	   inet addr:<pi ip> ..
	   ..

On your PC, log in over ssh to your pi to test:
	ssh pi@<pi ip>

On your PC, mount the pi root file system over ssh:
	mkdir piroot
	sshfs root@<pi ip>:/ piroot

You can now access the PI's entire file system in the piroot directory.
Neat, huh? This will allow you to replace the kernel, install modules
and edit files without having to plug in the PI's sd card into your PC.

Done!
