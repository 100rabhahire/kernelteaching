Learning a framework: Using regulators
======================================

In this exercise, you will learn how to use a new framework by implementing
support for turning on and off the LED by using the regulator framework.

0. Preparations
---------------

Make sure that you've completed the device driver exercise, and that you have
built the kernel with gpio-regulator support(as specified in the build 
exercise)

Read the kernel documentation on regulators. Search for it in Documentation/
The regulator to be used is specified in the led-keys device tree overlay,
so have a look at how to obtain the right regulator for the device.

Have a look at code using the regulator consumer API. Google for presentations.

1. Add a link between the device and the regulator
--------------------------------------------------

Q: There is a 1-1 mapping between a led-button device and a regulator controlling the led, what data structure should contain the link? 

What part of the code should get hold of regulator from the device tree?

Don't forget to handle errors. 

Q: Thee boiler plate driver code uses devm_ variants
of a lot of API resource-handling functions, why is this so good? How are resourced freed if there is an error during probe?

2. Control the LED with the button
----------------------------------

The LED should be off when the button is pressed(and on otherwise on).
Make sure that the module can be unloaded and loaded again.

Done!
